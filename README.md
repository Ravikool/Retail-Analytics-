Customer Segmentation of Online Retail Customers 

RFM Customer segmentation
The goal of RFM Analysis is to segment customers based on buying behavior. We need to understand the historical actions of individual customers for each RFM factor. We then rank customers based on each individual RFM factor, and finally pull all the factors together to create RFM segments for targeted marketing.

Can you identify your best customers?
Do you know who your worst customers are?
Do you know which customers you just lost, and which ones youâ€™re about to lose?
Can you identify loyal customers who buy often, but spend very little?
Can you target customers who are willing to spend the most at your store?
